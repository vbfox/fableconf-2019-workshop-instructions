# SAFE-Chat optimization workshop

![SAFE-Chat](FsChat-login.gif "Channel view")

## Requirements

To build the project (From the original readme)

* [dotnet SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core) 2.0.0 or higher
* [.NET Framework 4.6.1 Developer Pack](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49978) to run e2e tests
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org) 4.8.2 or higher
* yarn (`npm i yarn -g`)

To run the workshop:
* Chrome or Firefox (recent version)
* The React Dev Tools extension installed ([For Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en), [For Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/))

## Building and running the app

Clone the [SAFE-Chat-workshop](https://github.com/vbfox/SAFE-Chat-workshop) repository (âš  Not the original one âš )

Run `fake build` once to get everything setup.

Once done the easiest is to run in 2 terminals (Split the VSCode terminal for example) the following commands:
* ```
  cd src/Server
  dotnet watch run
  ```
* ```
  cs src/Client
  yarn start
  ```

The URL is http://127.0.0.1:8080 and you can use anonymous login.

To clear the server database (normally not needed): remove `src/Server/CHAT_DATA`.

## The Workshop

If you look at the changelog or join the **Demo** channel you'll notice that we have a
SPAM problem, someone is sending over and over the text of some obscure sketch.

Nicely they don't post too often but as they nicely say when you join (potentially drowned in the SPAM) you can change that :

> Welcome aboard, user speed is Slow say #slow #medium #fast or #viking to set my speed!

Let's open the console, say `#viking` and see what happens...
